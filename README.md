This is a repository for code used in the manuscript entitled “Focal adhesion-based cell migration is differentially regulated in vivo versus in vitro by Paxillin phosphorylation” by Xue et al.
This manuscript reveals the dynamics and regulation of focal adhesions (structures that link the cell cytoskeleton to the outside matrix) in migrating single cells in real-time in a living animal. The link to the paper will be updated here when accepted for publication.
The phosphoregulation of a key focal adhesion component, Paxillin, was functionally tested for its role in zebrafish macrophage migration. Three separate zebrafish lines were generated, each harboring a mutation in the tyrosine residue, Y118, of Paxillin: WT = wild type, Y118E = phosphomimetic, and Y118F = non-phosphorylatable. Larval zebrafish (2 day post-fertilization) tails were wounded to induce macrophage directed migration in each of these transgenic lines. Macrophage migration was imaged on a Leica Yokogawa CSU-W1 spinning disc confocal microscope, with a PL APO 40X/1.10 water immersion objective and an iXon Life 888 EMCCD camera at 28.5°C. Given that each larval zebrafish was oriented in different configurations, all x and y coordinates plotted in R were normalized to represent migration along the same axes toward the wound, and these data were represented as cell tracking plots in Figure 4E.
