Zebrafish cell migration tracking in phosphomutants
The separate files include code for macrophage cell migration of each distinct zebrafish genotype
(wild type = "wt", y118f = non-phosphorylatable, and y118e = phosphomimetic). 
This portion of the project aimed to compare directed migration rates across genotypes. Zebrafish tails were wounded to induce macrophage directed migration.
Cells were imaged using either a PL APO 40X/1.10 water immersion objective on a Leica Yokogawa CSU-W1 spinning disc confocal microscope 
with iXon Life 888 EMCCD camera at 28.5Â°C.
All x and y coordinated plotted in R were normalized to represent migration towards the same direction
since tail wounds were facing different directions in each fish.
